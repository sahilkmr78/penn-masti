His multifaceted talents aren't only on stage, however. He's also an aspiring triple major LSM student! And although he may look cute and cuddly on the outside, when he takes his shirt off, all the girls (and probably a few of the guys) will come running. Everyone on Masti knows that without a little Ashwin around to spice things up, our lives would be like a broken pencil-- pointless."

Off the dancefloor, he prefers to stray far from his flashy stage attire, and instead opts for his signature Masti T-shirt and sweatpants. Any hour of the day, you are likely to find him like this, lounging on a couch somewhere, computer in his lap, coding new websites or cramming for one of his numerous classes (...or maybe just watching dance videos on YouTube!).

Better known as \"Poops\", his effortless dancing, charming stage presence, and boat-rowing skills wow the audience every time he performs. Offstage, he can be found studying for his classes, playing volleyball, ordering the 5-star spicy drunken noodles from Thai Singha, or just falling asleep while skyping. Contrary to his nickname, Poops is all about the hygiene and is in Penn's 7-year Biodental program. Though he is actually one of Masti's busiest members, constantly going from classes to practices to meetings to research labs, he manages to make it all seem easy and always has time for his friends when we need him. In our beloved Poopy, Masti has found not only an amazing dancer and personal future dentist, but also one of the most fun-loving and understanding friends anyone could have."

She puts in hours on end to make sure Masti has the sickest choreo for literally any genre of dance: from filmy to classical to classical krump to bachata to our personal favorite, the peacock. But it's not just her moves that make us love Trisha...it's her amazingly idiotic laugh, her inner party animal, her ability to do every ridiculous dance move with no shame, her confidence to tell the world about her pants falling off at her first Masti practice, her inability to tell stories well, and most importantly her 24/7 availability to be there as a friend. No matter when you need her or what you need her for Trisha is the one person you can count on to support you, give you advice, or just make you laugh. And that's why we on Masti look up to her as la jefe <3"

It’s no wonder that she earned her nickname “Sassy Shikha.” Apart from that, with a background in ballet, jazz, and hip-hop, Shikha not only brings the sexy to Masti but also the weird. At any given hour, you can probably find her giggling as she studies eating or human anatomy. If you ever need a late night snack run, you can be sure that Shikha is awake and probably hungry. In the dance studio, Shikha is known for posing for obscure amounts of time in front of the mirror (not that any of us mind of course) while the rest of us sweat to death trying to remember choreography that Shikha picks up in minutes! While she’s simply breathtaking on and off the dance floor, she always makes time being an amazing friend and a big sister ready to sit down and have a late night heart-to-heart. However, the best thing about Shikha is how unbelievably friggin’ cute she is (seriously, her voice never goes below a certain octave)! Greeting anyone with a warm smile and a big hug, we can just never get enough of Shikha and that’s why we love her to death! =D"

From describing rainbows as “orgasm color bows” to using nipple twists as “hellos”, Ammar might be weird but no one on Masti can deny that he’s also wickedly brilliant. With a keen eye for detail and an immeasurable amount of experience working with music, it’s thanks to Ammar that Masti’s music cuts may be replaying in your head over and over again. Apart from that, with his amazing stage presence and a smile that will light up the world, it’s almost impossible to keep your eyes off him on and off the dance floor.  The sheer amount of energy and versatility that he brings to the table is sure to get you dancing in your seat (if you aren’t already dancing alongside him ;). But the reason why Masti loves Ammar is his capability to be the best “bruuaaahhh” you could ever have! As the most genuine and nicest person you could ever meet, you can be sure that Ammu will be there for you with an incredible expanse of wisdom, experience, and love that Masti just can’t get enough of. It’s almost a mystery how Masti ever existed without our incredible Ammu Beta."
