ashwin baweja 15: To-say-there is more than meets the eye about Ashwin Baweja would be an understatement. Ashwin, or as we call him, Shwindaddy, Shweiner, or Shwinny, is nothing less than a modern renaissance man. Ashwin does everything from raas to bhangra to filmy and he can’t get enough of any of them because he loves to dance! If there was a dance team for each one, he would probably join all of them. His multifaceted talents aren’t only on stage, however. He’s also an aspiring triple major LSM student! And although he may look cute and cuddly on the outside, when he takes his shirt off, all the girls (and probably a few of the guys) will come running. Everyone on Masti knows that without a little Ashwin around to spice things up, our lives would be like a broken pencil — pointless. —Anh Tran

mithin thomas 15: Mithin, aka Mittens and Mitts, is one of Masti’s finest members. Though he may seem like a quiet one at first, just turn on some hard-hitting hip-hop or bhangra music, and you’ll be sure to see his energetic side! Mithin is known to take very spontaneous cab rides all across Philly to see a movie, re-watch funny Youtube videos for hours, and go HAM at freestyling on the dance floor at parties. When he’s not with Masti, you can find Mithin on stage showing off his Oscar-worthy acting skills in Vietnamese Student Association Cultural Show plays. He gets his inspiration from a few of the Shahrukh Khan movies he’s checked off his “Bollywood Must See” bucket list. Mithin’s dimpled smile will never fail to brighten your day. Masti is so lucky to have such a talented, fun-loving dancer! —Trisha Sanghavi

nikhil naidu 16: Eshani,-also known as eesh or quiche, spent her entire life in Pembroke Pines before taking her talents from South Beach to Philly. She is truly a Floridian and struggles to cope with temperatures dipping below a frosty 70 degrees. While it may take her time to learn your name, Eshani learns new dances in a heartbeat and performs them beautifully. She is always getting ahead on her work and uses her intelligence and work ethic as she studies premed/predental/I’m not sure yet. If you are lucky enough to run into this stealthy girl on campus (an enviable trait during bird week) you can count on Eshani to cheer you up with a big smile and laugh at your jokes even if they’re not funny. She wishes she had a pony. —Nikhil Naidu
